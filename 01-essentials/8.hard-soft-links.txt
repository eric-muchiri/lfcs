Hard and soft(symbolic) links

In linux everything is a file(even directories)-a link to an inode

A file is a link to an inode

I-node - structure/metadata that stores everything about a file exept its name and actual content

hardlink - file that points to the same underlying inode as another file
    - only works within the same file system
    
softlink - A ink to another filename in the filesystem

To cretae a hardlink we use the 'ln' utility
e.g
`ln myfile test` - creates a link to myfile called test

symbolic link

'ln' utility with -s switch
`ln -s /tmp/myfile test2` - creates a file test2 which is a link to /tmp/               myfile
    
    when youu ls -l you see the file but doesn't begin with a - like a regular file. it begins with an l because it's a link
    
you can remove a link just like a regular file

`rm filename`
