00:01.150 --> 00:05.900
Hello and welcome back students knowing or just get our feet wet.

00:06.210 --> 00:16.330
What I'm going to do in this lecture is to log into the CLIA and just show you some very basic commands

00:17.370 --> 00:24.490
that way you'll get some idea and you'll start feeling comfortable around the Linux interface.

00:24.910 --> 00:26.890
If you're completely new to it.

00:27.160 --> 00:31.590
So we are in the windowing environment right now.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.930
I'm going to open a terminal and this is Sentosa by the way.

00:35.060 --> 00:39.420
Santos or Redhat whatever you want to call it.

00:40.370 --> 00:50.270
And currently we are the problem and just the fact that we like the dollar sign probably tells you that

00:50.270 --> 00:54.180
sonand root user who is logged in right now.

00:54.600 --> 00:55.230
OK.

00:55.400 --> 01:03.090
So I suppose if I want to find out who I am I log in as maybe I have switched back and forth from the

01:03.100 --> 01:09.650
root to some other user to log back to some other user and back to my cell and I caught last thought

01:09.710 --> 01:13.780
of lost track of who are logged in as the command is very simple.

01:13.790 --> 01:14.630
It's English word.

01:14.630 --> 01:16.040
Who am I.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.150
All together without any space.

01:18.800 --> 01:23.700
It tells me I'm logged in as Larry and

01:27.510 --> 01:31.460
suppose I lost track of where am I located.

01:31.530 --> 01:33.420
You know in the directory tree.

01:33.420 --> 01:35.310
Exactly where I'm located.

01:35.310 --> 01:37.720
I'll do a present working directory.

01:37.720 --> 01:45.840
P d it tells me I'm located in my home directory which is special Larry.

01:47.010 --> 01:53.630
I want to find out a listing of files that I currently am I not own any files at all.

01:53.670 --> 01:56.150
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create some file.

01:56.190 --> 02:07.790
A very quick way to create some files which are empty check nothing in them is like file 1 file to file.

02:08.740 --> 02:13.060
And I do ls and you see there are three files that I just created.

02:13.080 --> 02:13.920
Areikat.

02:14.380 --> 02:20.830
OK I just created three files and when I do it LS I find out that I have some basic information which

02:20.830 --> 02:33.150
was already there and if I do it LS dash E-L which is called The Long listing and I look down here.

02:33.630 --> 02:39.540
There are some files that are starting with the dash and these are file permissions that begin to talk

02:39.540 --> 02:47.880
about later on but the ones that are starting with a D they are directories and also on my screen they

02:47.940 --> 02:51.210
are shown as blue color.

02:51.660 --> 02:52.740
So these are directories.

02:52.740 --> 02:56.770
The one I the ones I just created are files.

02:57.180 --> 03:07.360
So for directories you have to go CD change directory and then suppose if I want to go to desktop and

03:07.360 --> 03:14.940
now my present working great Korea's slide show slash Larry slushed us top with a capital D.

03:14.940 --> 03:21.120
Linux is case sensitive so always make sure that you're using you're supposed to use upper or lower

03:21.120 --> 03:23.060
case because that could make a difference.

03:23.260 --> 03:29.180
If you do all lowercase desktop it will show you an air support let me do it actually.

03:29.280 --> 03:37.110
So currently I win and I'm going to do desktop and says no such file.

03:37.650 --> 03:41.620
And if you are a new Linux user you're going to say no it is not true.

03:41.740 --> 03:42.850
Is there a file is there.

03:42.850 --> 03:43.770
I've just seen it.

03:44.080 --> 03:49.540
But the reason it's not letting you in because there is no such thing as all lowercase desktop in your

03:49.540 --> 03:50.380
directory.

03:50.380 --> 03:56.720
You have to do cd capital D and then the rest of the work.

03:57.100 --> 04:02.940
And nobody likes you and you've got nothing in there right now so it doesn't show any files.

04:03.710 --> 04:08.660
You do a CD dub CD dot.

04:09.170 --> 04:17.800
Sorry Dad got I'll bring you up once step see you're back into your home directory and I have created

04:17.800 --> 04:18.790
3 files.

04:18.820 --> 04:20.550
But no I don't want them.

04:20.690 --> 04:36.630
So I'm going to do file one remove our aim is for remove while to remove want to remove what three and

04:36.630 --> 04:37.180
just do it.

04:37.180 --> 04:38.060
LS No.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.530
All my thoughts I got very moved.

04:42.480 --> 04:46.840
So another important are in for information.

04:47.130 --> 04:52.080
If you want to find out what my host name is currently I don't have the host name assigned to this machine

04:52.300 --> 04:57.320
so I showing local hall got local to me so I haven't assigned a domain yet.

04:57.330 --> 05:00.420
I haven't assigned a host name yet to this machine.

05:00.420 --> 05:08.950
I can also find out what the date is today and this shows the date the date command and I suppose if

05:08.950 --> 05:14.140
I want to change the password for Larry since I'm logged in as Larry that's the only password I can

05:14.140 --> 05:18.040
change right now I cannot change password for other people or for root.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.180
I can only change password for myself.

05:20.440 --> 05:28.660
When you do a PE P S S W D or lowercase l get ill ask you what your current password is suppose I on

05:28.660 --> 05:31.760
purpose enter a wrong password

05:34.500 --> 05:35.720
it give me this error.

05:35.730 --> 05:36.620
This way.

05:36.620 --> 05:37.350
Weird error.

05:38.390 --> 05:44.830
This basically saying you have to run password but this is sent to us way of telling you that you got

05:44.830 --> 05:45.800
the wrong password.

05:46.150 --> 05:47.670
But this is how you change the password.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.600
Piazza's W.D..

05:50.650 --> 05:58.740
And another command is his last lost user who logged on to this machine.

05:59.170 --> 06:05.110
This is the last user since Larry is the only user on it so far so he's the last user as well.

06:06.220 --> 06:13.870
I suppose I want to find out what is my version of operating system running.

06:14.010 --> 06:15.380
So I says Linux.

06:15.720 --> 06:16.870
But that's not good enough.

06:16.890 --> 06:20.770
I want to get more information so I do use the dash dash.

06:20.900 --> 06:29.650
Hello and gives you more options that are available that you can use with your name.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.690
So I want to type in your name

06:35.240 --> 06:39.060
Bash and that gives you a lot more information.

06:39.070 --> 06:45.940
It gives me what the operating system it what the domain name is but the host name is the actual architecture

06:46.000 --> 06:48.860
of my Linux operating system.

06:49.690 --> 06:57.050
The date it won't install or the date it was available are they did was created.

06:57.070 --> 07:00.020
All of that information is available.

07:00.910 --> 07:05.840
So these are some of the commands I wanted you to get a feel for linux right notes.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.040
So this is it.

07:08.290 --> 07:12.840
We get to get into more detail and more complex stuff in upcoming lectures.
