00:00.900 --> 00:05.630
Hello and welcome again in this lecture we get to talk about the Linux file system.

00:05.820 --> 00:11.600
So the top of the Linux system is the root system which is just a slash.

00:11.840 --> 00:17.590
And this is the logical beginning of the Linux file system structure.

00:17.790 --> 00:25.950
Every single falses file path in Linux begins from root in one way or the other as Slash contains the

00:25.950 --> 00:29.330
entirety of your operating system.

00:29.420 --> 00:36.230
Next one is slash bill which this is where most of your binary files are stored.

00:36.230 --> 00:41.280
Typically for the Linux terminal commands and core utilities such as CD

00:44.030 --> 00:50.410
PWT and the these are some of the covers we have already used in this course and something that they

00:50.410 --> 00:51.610
use in the future.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.990
But this is where they are kept.

00:55.040 --> 00:56.490
The next one is flash.

00:56.630 --> 01:03.490
This is where all the needed files for Linux to boot are kept and next one is slice death.

01:03.590 --> 01:11.680
This is very physical devices are mulcted such as hard drive us drives optical drives the CD-ROM.

01:11.840 --> 01:18.180
They already export the activity of system hard drive is mounted under slash def slash SDH.

01:18.510 --> 01:27.330
RAZ You use the thumb drive might be mounted under slash desk as d e so it differs from its different

01:27.330 --> 01:30.500
from you know different computers that have that differently.

01:30.540 --> 01:33.230
But it's always mongered and slash.

01:33.960 --> 01:38.840
Next one is the slash EDC which is the R at C also.

01:39.150 --> 01:45.950
This is one of the most important five system and this is what the configuration Pozza store.

01:46.610 --> 01:55.510
And for example one of the most important files is the host file which is this is where the host information

01:55.620 --> 01:58.220
hostname host IP address is located.

01:58.420 --> 01:59.830
It's the password file.

01:59.830 --> 02:04.320
This is where all the user passwords including the root user are located.

02:04.450 --> 02:07.390
So it's a very important system.

02:07.390 --> 02:09.350
Next one is slush Libe.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.370
And this is where libraries are kept.

02:12.370 --> 02:17.800
You'll notice that many times when installing little software packages additional libraries are also

02:17.800 --> 02:23.880
automatically downloaded and they almost always start with like dush of thing.

02:23.950 --> 02:27.600
These are basically the files needed for your programs on Linux to work.

02:27.640 --> 02:34.750
You can think of this folder as somewhat equal to the program files folder on Windows.

02:35.020 --> 02:40.180
The next one is slash media could be sliced CD-ROM as well.

02:40.280 --> 02:48.000
Another place where external drives such as optical devices and EULA's drives can be Mohmed next sort

02:48.000 --> 02:53.780
of slash MMD And as you can guess this is all too far but it's a placeholder it's an empty file.

02:53.790 --> 03:00.870
But what you do is I suppose if you have to if you want to use the necrophile system and Fs you would

03:00.870 --> 03:04.290
melt your file system files flash them into.

03:04.360 --> 03:09.890
I mean you could get anywhere you want but it's usually typically people moldered on human.

03:10.250 --> 03:18.560
And they share it so that people who are in the same network can access that phone system.

03:18.840 --> 03:26.520
The next one is slash BT are opt optional software for the system that is not already mandated by your

03:26.730 --> 03:28.350
distros package manager.

03:28.560 --> 03:35.500
So the stuff that's not installed by default can be stored here.

03:35.540 --> 03:36.190
It depends.

03:36.200 --> 03:40.070
You know you can install it anywhere in your system you can you can install it in your route if you

03:40.070 --> 03:40.580
want to.

03:40.610 --> 03:51.650
And if you have the space but good practice is to put it in slush or if you have additional optional

03:51.650 --> 03:59.360
software that you want to use the next point is the slash route which is the home directory for the

03:59.360 --> 04:00.060
user.

04:00.950 --> 04:07.180
So like I remember in our example we had slash slash Larry that was Larry's home directory.

04:07.370 --> 04:13.930
So all in all non-root users will have their home directories in slash hole flash something they'll

04:13.940 --> 04:17.700
use a user name but for root is just slash.

04:17.980 --> 04:21.960
This is where root files are kept.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.390
The next one is slash Espin.

04:24.470 --> 04:32.300
It's similar to slash except that it is dedicated to certain commands that can only be run by the user

04:32.420 --> 04:34.190
or the super user.

04:34.190 --> 04:37.240
Next one is slash TMB are temporary files.

04:37.250 --> 04:44.800
This is also used in one of our modules up before and this is our temporary files are stored and they

04:44.800 --> 04:50.390
are usually deleted up punch at them which saves you from having to manually delete them like is required

04:50.390 --> 04:51.060
in Windows.

04:51.260 --> 04:53.470
So they are not there permanently.

04:53.510 --> 04:59.250
You only put stuff that you don't want to be stored permanently.

04:59.340 --> 05:07.870
The next system is the first one to slash user which contains files and utilities that are shared between

05:07.870 --> 05:08.570
users.

05:10.730 --> 05:12.380
Next one is slash var.

05:12.380 --> 05:15.250
This is also very important and you're going to be using that a lot.

05:15.430 --> 05:21.690
The variable data kept usually system locks but could also include other types of it.

05:21.710 --> 05:23.000
I well to see some logs.

05:23.030 --> 05:28.630
Our var log messages are one of the files that you access a lot.

05:28.630 --> 05:34.570
Suppose if there are any kind of crash order to think like that you look at var log messages so SSAS

05:34.730 --> 05:36.550
slash mark slash log.

05:38.950 --> 05:42.900
And the last one is the slash Proc. processes.

05:42.970 --> 05:47.640
This is where a lot of system information is represented as files.

05:47.720 --> 05:54.140
It is basically provides a way for the Linux kernel the core of the system to send and receive information

05:54.140 --> 05:57.110
from various processes running in the Linux environment.
