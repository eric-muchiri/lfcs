Low students and Balcom in this lecture we're going to talk about regular expressions and recommend

00:07.920 --> 00:16.200
regular expressions are special text strings that are used to search for and match patterns in text

00:16.830 --> 00:19.440
to make the search expression more specific.

00:19.440 --> 00:25.630
It can work together with the grep command the grep command is a general regular expression parser that

00:25.780 --> 00:32.310
that's what stands for such as a file for string latches matching a giving regular expression and by

00:32.310 --> 00:37.400
default it prints out any line containing a string that matches it.

00:37.410 --> 00:42.240
There are many useful options which can be set for grep which affect its output.

00:42.670 --> 00:48.800
Are we going to use some examples in order to demonstrate how to use grep and regular expressions is

00:48.810 --> 00:53.280
by actually typing in the command grep.

00:53.280 --> 01:02.160
And suppose we are we want to print all the user names that begin with the letter E in a were at c password

01:02.160 --> 01:03.120
file.

01:03.120 --> 01:17.220
So in order to do that we'll use single quotes the carrot sign the end of code and we're going to check

01:17.220 --> 01:23.060
our ETSI passport file to see if passport file has anything that begin with the letter.

01:23.450 --> 01:25.180
It has nothing in it.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.310
So it came up empty.

01:27.330 --> 01:41.810
OK let's try another one group again the card the end of Code sorry this time not a word try J.

01:42.630 --> 01:45.640
Let's do the password again.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.170
And there we have an entry.

01:48.270 --> 01:57.000
So we have a user named Joseph ETSI password file and he showed up his entire entry from the password

01:57.000 --> 01:57.680
file.

01:57.690 --> 02:04.410
So this is a quick way off instead of actually doing a more on Etsy password are doing a V-I of the

02:04.440 --> 02:05.140
password.

02:05.280 --> 02:12.210
We were able to locate him and without even knowing Joseph how to spell jail I suppose if you are one

02:12.210 --> 02:18.990
of those people whose spelling is really bad and you don't want to guess then all I did is just use

02:18.990 --> 02:21.500
the first character of his name.

02:21.820 --> 02:30.870
And we were able to pull the entire name and the entire password entry for him and I knowing this password

02:30.870 --> 02:36.240
file is another user whose name starts with a capital G.

02:36.570 --> 02:45.530
So of course by default grep only picks up stuff in lowercase but in Linux remember Lorqess supposed

02:45.540 --> 02:51.590
if there's a Joeseph with a capital G he is different from Joeseph with the lowercase g.

02:52.530 --> 02:56.620
So we get to run the same comment except the difference is going to be grep.

02:56.640 --> 03:03.010
Gosh I am still going to search for J.

03:03.090 --> 03:04.330
Starting with J.

03:04.710 --> 03:05.840
And in a D.

03:05.870 --> 03:07.410
C password file.

03:08.220 --> 03:12.070
And this time it picks it picks up two names.

03:12.140 --> 03:13.320
What Joseph.

03:13.320 --> 03:19.770
One with a capital one with the lowercase g and this is due to the fact that we have added AI that we

03:19.770 --> 03:21.810
want to see everything that starts a J.

03:21.840 --> 03:24.430
Regardless of what case it is.

03:25.080 --> 03:32.050
So as you can see this becomes fairly easy and especially if you are writing a script you can use the

03:32.140 --> 03:39.750
grep command gets used a lot in scripting also and you can parse different values from a file without

03:39.750 --> 03:44.540
actually going into the file and your script will be able to do it automatically.

03:44.550 --> 03:47.330
Let's do one more example.

03:47.990 --> 03:49.320
And we get a graph.

03:49.320 --> 03:59.140
For Let's say H but instead of beginning with H we going to say something that ends with H.

03:59.250 --> 04:06.520
So how do you do that grep h dollar sign.

04:07.480 --> 04:15.930
Us going to tell it to look for names are anything that ends with H.

04:16.250 --> 04:19.460
And as you can see all the bash bin bash.

04:19.460 --> 04:24.560
This is not specifically for users it's for anything that ends with an h.

04:24.740 --> 04:32.120
So Ben Bash is in my current file because it's not too populated right now so the only thing he could

04:32.120 --> 04:37.340
find was the bin bash directory.
