00:00.950 --> 00:01.960
Fellow users.

00:02.170 --> 00:08.290
So this is not something I was planning on doing but since it came up in the last lecture that I did

00:08.290 --> 00:11.640
not assign the host name or domain name to my server.

00:11.910 --> 00:15.720
So I'm going to show you declasse do it all.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.630
It's far advanced right now for you guys because we're just starting off.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.870
So don't worry about remembering any of this.

00:21.910 --> 00:28.860
I just want you to sort of remember the process that you go through in order to change the host.

00:29.170 --> 00:39.170
So currently I've changed it to my server and I'm going to change it to Santos dash unless and s.c.s

00:39.380 --> 00:41.990
sorry to think about it for a second.

00:42.010 --> 00:43.080
LS see us.

00:43.290 --> 00:45.420
So let's do that.

00:51.330 --> 00:55.590
So first I'm going to become the super user as you are.

00:55.590 --> 01:00.780
SU is actually for switch user that I you for the password.

01:00.780 --> 01:06.950
I'm going to put the superuser password and now you see a hash sign or pound sign.

01:07.410 --> 01:10.880
And that means I am root

01:15.240 --> 01:16.480
take root on top.

01:16.500 --> 01:22.980
Who writes his root so not have the power to change stuff.

01:23.340 --> 01:31.440
So first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to use the editor vi editor and I'm going to go into this

01:31.440 --> 01:46.160
file see sis can sit slash network and I help change the host name to this my server but I don't want

01:46.160 --> 01:47.200
this I want to change

01:54.560 --> 01:59.950
so in order to change anything you have to type it to get into insert mode.

02:00.360 --> 02:08.500
So l f c s dash sorry Centaurus gosh.

02:11.270 --> 02:12.890
Dot Teske got code.

02:13.090 --> 02:15.380
This is my fully qualified domain.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.450
That's what's called S D N

02:20.340 --> 02:26.980
and W Q then is what you type in to get out of the vi editor after saving it.

02:27.330 --> 02:33.090
If you just do a shoe bag that's going to let you quit without hitting anything.

02:33.090 --> 02:37.620
So if you made any changes that you don't want to say you think you messed up.

02:37.710 --> 02:40.980
Easy way to get out of it is cubing together.

02:41.700 --> 02:42.960
OK the next time.

02:42.990 --> 02:48.240
Let's follow that I'm going to go into his VI and see just fine.

02:50.550 --> 02:51.870
As you can see I have

02:55.030 --> 02:59.950
I have the IP address which is not really a working IP address right now I just put it in there just

02:59.950 --> 03:05.050
to show you this is the format and I want to change it here as well.

03:06.650 --> 03:07.640
So I'm going to delete it.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.350
You deleted that this small.

03:09.590 --> 03:15.920
If I just keep typing X is going to keep deleting the characters and then when I type it try to insert

03:16.610 --> 03:21.670
and then change it to send thoss out.

03:21.830 --> 03:32.240
See as Doc test got cut and then space hostname Actually I had two tabs in there in order to have a

03:32.750 --> 03:36.000
host name that far I want to I can bring you closer.

03:36.050 --> 03:41.720
Doesn't really matter white space is white space is white space and Lileks could be one space or five

03:41.720 --> 03:42.830
spaces.

03:42.830 --> 03:51.700
So that tells the system that this is the host name and get a skate key and that WQ thing and I say

03:51.700 --> 03:52.820
that not.

03:53.680 --> 04:00.280
But in order for it to take a fact are two things you can do you get either reboot the machine and then

04:00.280 --> 04:07.150
the system will recognize during the reboot that there's been a change that the host made or you can

04:07.150 --> 04:13.570
do it while the systems run so another.

04:14.420 --> 04:18.350
So the way to do that is eat c it.

04:18.350 --> 04:22.880
D network restart

04:25.420 --> 04:27.790
and you've got to know that it's been restarted.

04:29.440 --> 04:35.670
And so far as you can see it's showing my server as the name of the server but you change it already

04:36.080 --> 04:44.890
some exit out of it and there's one more step to this and which is hostname.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.400
And then my host name is Santo's

04:51.000 --> 04:52.120
Bell s.c.s

04:54.650 --> 04:58.320
test code.

04:58.470 --> 05:05.380
If I do a hostname at this point see not showing the new hostname but if you look at my problem this

05:05.400 --> 05:08.520
still says my server.

05:08.760 --> 05:16.570
So in order to change that I have to run this command and don't worry about these two men.

05:16.750 --> 05:21.920
I don't want you to be overwhelmed about this because you're going to go over each of these later on

05:26.650 --> 05:35.040
it out and log back in after exiting out completely and now you can see that I'm showing the new hostname

05:35.590 --> 05:41.610
and if I type the hostname command at this point this is the hostname with the domain name as well.

05:41.610 --> 05:42.590
Test dot com.

05:44.140 --> 05:44.570
OK.

05:44.820 --> 05:51.450
So sorry this was a segue kind of not intended initially but I just thought it would be a good idea

05:51.540 --> 05:57.890
for us to do it because I didn't do it initially and once we actually get to this topic then it would

05:57.880 --> 05:58.760
make more sense to.
