Hello and welcome in this lecture we get to summarize what we have learned in the domain one which is

00:08.180 --> 00:13.070
essential command and it's 25 percent off your exam.

00:13.070 --> 00:18.860
Now keep in mind that you're not going to be question every single competencies that they have listed

00:18.860 --> 00:20.520
in every single domain.

00:21.020 --> 00:26.630
So but this is a good idea to cover all of that.

00:26.830 --> 00:31.050
So that way if your question about that you'll be able to answer.

00:31.450 --> 00:37.890
So we will learn how to log into local and remote graphical and textmode Cottle's we search for files

00:37.900 --> 00:44.860
and evaluated and compared the basic file system we compared in many plated file content we used to

00:44.860 --> 00:50.440
input output redirection we text using basic regular expressions.

00:50.550 --> 00:58.270
The archive backup compress and packaged in uncompressed files we created deleted copy and move files

00:58.270 --> 01:02.160
and directories we created and manage hard and soft links.

01:02.260 --> 01:09.640
We have done listings setting and changing all the standard file permissions you have read and use system

01:09.640 --> 01:12.190
documentation.

01:12.250 --> 01:18.390
We have managed access to the root user which has basically switched user you do from regular users

01:18.390 --> 01:24.100
or you do switch user and type in the root password and your root.

01:24.130 --> 01:29.200
So this is it in the next section we get to start with domain 2.

01:29.470 --> 01:36.190
And also I'm going to add some quizzes some assignments to go with your domain.

01:36.190 --> 01:40.480
Want to make sure that we have everything that's covered.

01:40.940 --> 01:46.600
Give you some practice to do hands on stuff the only way you're going to learn and be good at the task

01:46.690 --> 01:53.800
is you install your own system and actually practice it because this is not memorization it's a performance

01:53.800 --> 01:58.730
based test and you have to know what you're doing by doing it by hand.

01:58.950 --> 01:59.700
OK.

01:59.950 --> 02:01.350
So we'll see in the next section.
