00:00.700 --> 00:06.100
Hello students and welcome in this lecture we're going to talk about the Linux wine comment which is

00:06.100 --> 00:13.870
one of the most important and much use command and Linux systems fine commands used to search and locate

00:13.990 --> 00:20.500
lists to files and directories based on conditions that use this file of files that match the arguments

00:21.020 --> 00:28.360
fine can be used in a variety of conditions like you can find files permissions by users by groups by

00:28.360 --> 00:33.200
file type by date by size and you can use other criteria.

00:33.210 --> 00:39.490
Also So we log into our Linux machine and we're going to use some examples.

00:39.490 --> 00:42.690
So one of the things that you can do I haven't discussed that yet.

00:42.970 --> 00:50.740
There's a thing there's a help feature clinics in all standard Linux machines which is called manual

00:50.740 --> 00:52.670
pages or man pages.

00:52.810 --> 00:57.460
So you need to look up information that you're not sure about.

00:57.460 --> 00:59.280
You can type mad.

00:59.410 --> 01:06.580
And then the command that you're looking for like in my case or look up find and Ill give you pages

01:06.580 --> 01:13.000
after pages of depending on how intense that command and how much detail it needs.

01:13.140 --> 01:18.770
But it's got quite a bit of detail on the syntax and the use of the find command.

01:18.970 --> 01:25.060
So going into the details of this right now will probably be too much will be overkill because right

01:25.060 --> 01:27.370
now you're just going on a flight find command.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.870
Just type 2 to get out of it.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.330
But I wanted to show that feature of Linux.

01:32.490 --> 01:39.340
Any time you have any confusion instead of going to Google you can just type in man for that command.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.320
So we'll start off with a very simple example.

01:43.320 --> 01:47.340
The reason I log in as root is when you're writing a file command.

01:47.670 --> 01:54.360
If you log it as a non-root user and you're searching through your entire system that you're going to

01:54.360 --> 02:02.270
be a lot of file file systems a lot of directories that go on route user would not have access to.

02:02.310 --> 02:04.340
They can't even see what's in there.

02:04.440 --> 02:07.950
So you're going to get a lot of permission denied.

02:08.100 --> 02:11.270
If you want to read the fine command as a regular user.

02:11.460 --> 02:17.850
So that's why it's a good idea to run a fine command as root user so that way it will go through each

02:17.850 --> 02:22.650
and every directory and sub directory and get you the output that you're looking for.

02:23.940 --> 02:30.190
So suppose in the root directory I know when you have the backslash that that's also called the root

02:30.190 --> 02:30.960
directory.

02:31.150 --> 02:32.450
So on the root directory right.

02:32.470 --> 02:34.440
No let's see what I have in here.

02:34.540 --> 02:34.780
OK.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.640
These are like the general files.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.990
There are a couple of files that I have created.

02:39.310 --> 02:46.210
So what I'm going to do is create a clone of called touch test.

02:46.270 --> 02:50.060
TIA XTi pretext just created that.

02:50.110 --> 02:51.290
Now we're going to find it.

02:51.390 --> 02:54.040
See if my system can find it fine.

02:55.410 --> 03:01.560
This is the syntax doc means you start from the current directory where I am right on the present working

03:01.560 --> 03:02.540
directory.

03:02.700 --> 03:10.020
Then you type in Dasch name kik name of the file that's to follow.

03:10.020 --> 03:14.800
Test the test doc XTi.

03:14.980 --> 03:19.780
Now since I only have one file that should give me the output of that one file that I just created.

03:20.830 --> 03:24.190
Well I created one before which is under Larry.

03:24.280 --> 03:27.640
So it's on both of a test doc TXI.

03:28.230 --> 03:28.590
OK.

03:28.690 --> 03:30.080
So that's how simple it is.

03:30.190 --> 03:36.110
Just you need to remember the syntax of it and if you forget just look up many pages.

03:36.370 --> 03:43.980
So in this case we use the dot to tell the system to start finding from our current directory.

03:44.140 --> 03:48.000
But what if I want to specify a particular directory.

03:48.370 --> 03:59.010
OK so now what I've done is I want to slash hole that is still owned by root and I created a file there

03:59.610 --> 04:02.190
which is called test to the test.

04:02.440 --> 04:07.690
OK so I'm going to use the same fine commands this time but instead of using the dot on the specifying

04:07.690 --> 04:17.510
the actual directory which is slash home dash name of the file and I'm going to call it test to test

04:17.540 --> 04:17.780
you.

04:17.970 --> 04:19.860
We'll see if our system will find it.

04:19.980 --> 04:24.950
And yes he did find it and give you the exact part of where that file is located.

04:25.170 --> 04:30.990
So right now I'm using very simple example whatever I'm trying to fight it gets found right away and

04:30.990 --> 04:33.900
there's only one instance of it at work.

04:34.240 --> 04:40.320
If you are on a server which has been up for a while doing a lot of stuff then you're going to have

04:40.320 --> 04:46.560
several instances of that file probably at different locations and your system is going to take a while

04:46.940 --> 04:47.640
too.

04:47.780 --> 04:48.830
Might take me a while.

04:48.830 --> 04:55.020
I mean could take probably 30 seconds or a minute depending on how much stuff you have or how much the

04:55.020 --> 04:59.100
system has to go through in order to get you the right file that you're looking for.

04:59.100 --> 05:04.150
But right now it's very quick for us because it's a test machine and I don't have too much installing

05:04.160 --> 05:05.490
it right now.

05:06.270 --> 05:06.570
OK.

05:06.570 --> 05:14.810
One more example before we finished that discussion of box fight is we want to fight all the empty files.

05:15.140 --> 05:15.900
OK.

05:16.020 --> 05:22.210
So I remember how to find out where we are currently.

05:22.230 --> 05:26.470
You do present working directory r p w d enter.

05:26.510 --> 05:29.020
So I'm in slash T P right.

05:29.020 --> 05:34.960
So I mean the root directory and the subject is T.M..

05:35.900 --> 05:41.090
Anything that you don't want to keep for a long time in Linux just make it a habit of putting in TMB

05:41.510 --> 05:46.370
because you can you can remember to remove the furnace but you're done with it.

05:46.370 --> 05:52.910
So what I've done I use the touch commit have and then I've created empty

05:55.570 --> 05:58.320
empty want and empty to an empty three.

05:58.470 --> 05:58.710
OK.

05:58.720 --> 05:59.760
This is how I get it.

05:59.950 --> 06:04.680
So what I'm going to have my find command go in search all these empty files.

06:04.720 --> 06:10.640
See if it can actually find so I'm going to type in the pack first.

06:10.640 --> 06:13.030
So fight in slash term.

06:13.070 --> 06:16.850
I'm telling my systems specifically go to slash.

06:17.070 --> 06:28.790
Don't worry by looking anywhere else type af this is that because the file so and the file type is in.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.070
Let's see if it can find it.

06:31.070 --> 06:37.760
It found all three files that I have because when you create a file with a touch command it is empty

06:38.690 --> 06:44.450
because touch command is used just for testing purposes that if you have write access to a certain directory

06:44.750 --> 06:50.060
because you don't have write access you're going to get a message denied that you don't have write permission

06:50.390 --> 06:52.450
to write anything in this directory.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.790
It will let you create a file even by touch.

06:55.790 --> 07:00.080
So that's what touches use for and that's why these files are empty.

07:00.080 --> 07:06.510
They have nothing in them unless you use a vi editor going to the flop and actually write something

07:06.510 --> 07:09.120
in there and then save it then you have something.

07:09.530 --> 07:12.450
OK this is our discussion about flight.
