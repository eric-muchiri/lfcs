Hello in this lecture we're going to talk about links hard links and soft links in Linux.

00:06.980 --> 00:15.600
So in Linux everything is a file which means file is a file and it treats directory as a file as well

00:15.780 --> 00:21.130
although we know the difference but as far as Linux is concerned it is treating.

00:21.130 --> 00:26.560
You can pretty much do all of the commands that you can do on a file you can do on our directory as

00:26.560 --> 00:32.520
well and a file is fundamentally a link to an iPod.

00:32.840 --> 00:33.250
What is it.

00:33.250 --> 00:37.660
I know I know it is a data structure that stores everything about a file.

00:37.660 --> 00:40.440
Apart from his name an actual code.

00:40.600 --> 00:44.550
So a very important interview question also what isn't I.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.280
So I know it's a method that.

00:46.310 --> 00:53.360
Or a structure that stores everything about a file at the site except his name its name and sexual content.

00:54.510 --> 01:00.870
So hardlink is a file that points to the same underlying note as under the file in case you delete one

01:00.870 --> 01:04.010
file it will remove Royland to the.

01:04.050 --> 01:12.300
I note as a symbolic link or soft link is a link to another file in the file system.

01:12.300 --> 01:17.070
Another important difference between the two types of legs is that hard links can only work within the

01:17.070 --> 01:25.220
same file system while symbolic links can go across different file systems in order to create hard lines.

01:25.230 --> 01:28.040
In Linux we will use the and utility.

01:28.350 --> 01:37.330
For example the following command creates a hardlink will do l s dash L to see what we have in the file

01:37.330 --> 01:39.320
system right now.

01:39.480 --> 01:45.010
I have a script called my script so what I'm gonna do I'll do.

01:45.040 --> 01:48.690
Alan my script

01:53.690 --> 01:56.280
at all call it test.

01:56.590 --> 01:56.840
Could

02:01.400 --> 02:13.160
and all do ls dashed out and you can see that it has been created right here as a link right now looking

02:13.160 --> 02:18.190
at the output using ls command are the new file is not indicated as a link.

02:18.230 --> 02:22.200
It is shown as a regular file that employs that.

02:22.610 --> 02:25.390
The test file that we just created.

02:25.400 --> 02:30.400
The link is just another regular executable file that points to the same underlying.

02:30.440 --> 02:37.180
I know as of our original file which was my script.

02:37.710 --> 02:45.000
So now we going to deal with the how to create symbolically so in order to create a symbolic link symbolic

02:45.020 --> 02:49.940
link will use same Ellen utility with that dash as such.

02:49.940 --> 02:55.000
So for example what I have done is remember we had a script called my script.

02:55.100 --> 03:01.230
I had moved it to slash T and P Just to show you that it goes cross file system across file systems

03:01.610 --> 03:03.770
so we going to create a link here.

03:03.830 --> 03:09.340
But actually the link is created for the file which is the design which resides in slushed term.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.530
And right now we own Larry's home directory.

03:12.530 --> 03:14.540
So we're going to do.

03:14.540 --> 03:30.670
LS Alynda asked and then slashed VMP slash my script and then we get a call at let's call it a test

03:31.110 --> 03:40.300
to get our link is created.

03:40.760 --> 03:46.420
And here you can see at the bottom of the screen this is showing an out.

03:46.600 --> 03:51.560
You remember the file types that were discussed the file permissions in one of the previous lectures.

03:51.590 --> 03:53.050
So here tells you right.

03:53.170 --> 03:53.650
And you do it.

03:53.660 --> 04:00.960
LS dash L that this the bottom file is a link and it's link.

04:00.980 --> 04:06.340
Test 2 is actually linked to the file call slash temp slash.

04:06.500 --> 04:18.140
So now you can access it anywhere probably within the system within this server and you can go if you

04:18.140 --> 04:19.120
want to see it.

04:19.220 --> 04:20.640
You can see to test to.

04:20.670 --> 04:27.510
You can see two slashed him slash my skirt and you'll end up getting at the same point.

04:28.460 --> 04:32.210
And suppose once you're done with the link you don't need it anymore.

04:32.510 --> 04:38.240
Instead of it being just a stale net links on where you can go and remove it just like you would remove

04:38.330 --> 04:39.320
any of the file.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.610
So remember our link is test.

04:42.170 --> 04:48.790
And I'm just going to use the remove command which is our m test too.

04:49.140 --> 04:54.190
And when we do our LS dash L is gone.

04:54.380 --> 04:55.240
Tester's.

04:55.710 --> 04:57.370
So that link that we create.

04:57.390 --> 05:00.060
It doesn't show us there and it's gone.
