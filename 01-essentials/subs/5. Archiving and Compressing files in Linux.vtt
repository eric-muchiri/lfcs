Hello and welcome in this lecture we get to talk about Linux archiving and compression tools.

00:07.170 --> 00:15.900
So file our cutting tool groups a set of files into a single standalone file that can be backed up to

00:15.900 --> 00:18.030
several files of media.

00:18.060 --> 00:22.080
It can be transferred across a network are sent via email.

00:22.200 --> 00:27.960
The most frequently used frequently use our common utility in linnets is called Taar.

00:28.200 --> 00:35.700
Then in archiving utilities use along with the compression tool it allows to reduce the disk size that

00:35.700 --> 00:39.090
is needed to store the same files and information.

00:39.090 --> 00:46.440
So basically if you have like say three files that's taking like 50 megs there are big file and a few

00:46.590 --> 00:50.230
tar them and combine all three of them together.

00:50.760 --> 00:53.200
Then it'll take a lot less space than 15 minutes.

00:53.520 --> 01:00.110
And once you send them wherever you want to send them via email or via whatever means and then untired

01:00.150 --> 01:04.830
them and you'll have the original three files back with whatever size they had.

01:08.310 --> 01:11.880
So tar bundles a group of files together into a single archive.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.120
It's commonly called a tar file our tar balls.

01:15.390 --> 01:21.360
The name originally stood for tape archiver but we must note that you can use this tool to archive data

01:21.660 --> 01:23.360
to any kind of ridable media.

01:23.370 --> 01:32.190
Not only tapes TAR is normally used with a compression tool such as zip zip to our Z to produce a compressed

01:32.200 --> 01:41.460
top 10 are we going to use some examples in which we're going to use all three compression tools which

01:41.460 --> 01:49.860
is that GZ got busy too and got X and we're going to see examples of all three of them.

01:49.860 --> 01:57.080
So I have five files here which is file one to file five just by using touch.

01:57.540 --> 02:04.430
And now I am going to archive all five of them by using the three compression methods.

02:04.480 --> 02:16.200
So the first one is going to be car C Z af and I'll tell you what that means in a minute my files on

02:16.260 --> 02:26.590
TAR but gz file when you are using one through five.

02:27.450 --> 02:27.910
OK.

02:27.990 --> 02:34.690
So in the c z f c is that you are creating a tar archive.

02:34.800 --> 02:40.440
That's what the C is for zes to process archive to Jees it.

02:40.500 --> 02:43.060
So Zipp that's where the Z comes from.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.080
And Fs are filed.

02:46.020 --> 02:52.710
And if you want to look up more information on Taar you can of course Newcomen tar in all the details

02:52.890 --> 02:55.900
of the syntax and all the options available.

02:56.160 --> 03:01.820
OK so this is going to tar all of her files into one tarball.

03:02.430 --> 03:03.710
Let's see just creative.

03:04.130 --> 03:04.670
Yeah.

03:04.920 --> 03:09.000
The red one right here is the file.

03:09.210 --> 03:12.860
No let's use the other compression method which is busy too.

03:13.180 --> 03:27.180
So no you're going to do TAR c g f my files got tar got B C to a good file

03:30.100 --> 03:33.420
1 through 5.

03:34.780 --> 03:44.100
In this case C again is to create a time archive small just to process the archive to be easy to take.

03:44.470 --> 03:49.620
And see that's created and second was created as well.

03:50.290 --> 03:57.660
And we're going to use the last compression method which is Taar see capital G.

03:58.570 --> 04:10.960
If my file got Taar dot X Z while 1 through 5.

04:11.930 --> 04:21.960
Google then all three bundles are tarballs created here and you can use a command which is LS dash h

04:23.130 --> 04:27.000
and then grep for TAR.

04:27.000 --> 04:35.300
Ill give you the exact size off the tar balls so you can compare this to the original size of your file

04:36.050 --> 04:38.780
to see if it's less or not it should be

04:41.770 --> 04:49.380
no wonder you look at the contents of one of my tower files so I'll do a tar tee vee.

04:50.540 --> 05:05.320
My Files tar dog g z and it shows me that inside my tar tar ball I have file 1 2 5 5.

05:05.330 --> 05:07.010
These are the contents of them.

05:07.710 --> 05:15.590
Now next step is going to be we get to run the compression again which will be like jeez if gash d my

05:15.590 --> 05:22.260
files got tar not GZ.

05:22.820 --> 05:29.070
The second one is going to be B zip to dash D.

05:29.430 --> 05:36.700
My Files got tar dog be easy to see.

05:36.830 --> 05:37.720
Already exists.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.130
You've done it once before.

05:39.410 --> 05:43.460
And the last one is going to be X Z dash D.

05:43.940 --> 05:45.530
My Files.

05:45.530 --> 05:48.980
Gosh doc tar doc x.

05:49.090 --> 05:54.830
So on the last one there was no Phyliss just file.

05:54.990 --> 06:00.080
So instead of doing files we'll just do file

06:05.810 --> 06:08.710
so we got the three guys create it in.

06:08.810 --> 06:17.820
We actually shipped over tar ball and now we want to extract it to to get the original files back.

06:18.080 --> 06:27.460
So in order to do that you have to run the tar X V.F..

06:27.560 --> 06:30.060
Are we going to target the file.

06:30.200 --> 06:39.310
So the command for that is starting with again x x x access for extraction vse for verbose interface

06:39.380 --> 06:40.320
for file.

06:40.730 --> 06:44.030
And I'm going to use one example out of three.

06:44.440 --> 06:45.370
And there we go.

06:47.260 --> 06:50.610
All of our five files are extracted again.

06:52.100 --> 06:54.130
Samples that are in your location this time.

06:54.560 --> 07:00.670
All of this was our discussion of how you archive a file and compress a file.

07:00.900 --> 07:04.480
It's a very broad subject and we can go into further detail about that.

07:04.490 --> 07:11.180
But as far as the exam problem point of view is concerned I think this much in intermissions is should

07:11.180 --> 07:12.180
be sufficient.

07:12.620 --> 07:20.090
And you can look at the man pages just to look at some other options that are available in the tar utility's.
