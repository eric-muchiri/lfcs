00:01.300 --> 00:06.470
In this lecture we're going to talk about Linux file permissions in the file permissions.

00:06.470 --> 00:11.690
The first 10 characters in the output of ls dash l ls.

00:11.690 --> 00:14.510
By the way is file listing.

00:14.540 --> 00:20.280
If you are in a directory and you just type LS you'll get all the files that are under that directory

00:20.480 --> 00:28.430
is similar to dossers are windows deicer command directory Diyar.

00:28.630 --> 00:29.320
So what.

00:29.350 --> 00:30.040
Ls.

00:30.080 --> 00:36.040
Ill give you a long listing it gives you a little bit more information instead of just the filenames.

00:36.550 --> 00:42.800
So the files the first of these characters is used to indicate the file types or the file type could

00:42.800 --> 00:45.860
be just a hyphen which is a regular file.

00:45.920 --> 00:49.810
It could start with the D which is a directory.

00:50.210 --> 00:58.390
It could start with an L which is a symbolic link could start with the C which is a character device

00:59.360 --> 01:03.170
and it could also start with a dash B are blocked device.

01:03.500 --> 01:09.560
So the next nine characters of the file attributes are called the file mode and represent the read write

01:09.620 --> 01:13.800
and execute permissions of the files owners the files.

01:13.810 --> 01:21.020
Group owner and the rest of the users commonly referred to as the world whereas the read permission

01:21.020 --> 01:28.640
on a file allows the same to be open and read the same permission on a directory allows its contents

01:28.640 --> 01:29.650
to be listed.

01:29.870 --> 01:36.770
If the execute command is also set and here's I have an example.

01:36.770 --> 01:40.640
This is what read write and execute look like.

01:40.820 --> 01:44.810
So up if you are familiar with binary numbers.

01:45.140 --> 01:53.060
If you are familiar with binary numbers you'll have to do the power zero which means one to the power

01:53.060 --> 02:02.110
one which is two to the power 2 which is for you add them up and that's number 7.

02:02.570 --> 02:07.880
Here we have nothing here nothing here.

02:08.120 --> 02:14.740
That means that there is no binary number here but R has a two part too.

02:15.440 --> 02:19.130
So that means there is a 4 so that addition is 4.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.120
Same way here.

02:20.150 --> 02:25.860
So the file permission if this is given to a particular file will be 7:04 for.

02:25.970 --> 02:33.470
That means that the owner has all the permission read write and execute the group owner only has read

02:33.470 --> 02:39.920
permission rest of the world has only read permission as well and we look at it in a minute.

02:39.960 --> 02:46.410
In the system so we are logged into our machine right now.

02:46.660 --> 02:54.090
I'm going to do an ls l and this is what you were talking about seeing the beginning if you have a D.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.810
That's a directory.

02:56.110 --> 03:00.380
If you have a dash only that moves as a regular file.

03:00.640 --> 03:08.020
I don't have an example off a block or character device in it but it will be represented by a b or c

03:08.200 --> 03:15.730
lowercase and if is a symbolic link which we going to talk about later in the course which will be presented

03:15.730 --> 03:18.890
by dasht L.

03:19.000 --> 03:26.200
So we get to for example we are going to take one of our files say say take Faulhaber Faltu.

03:26.350 --> 03:34.800
This Americare So currently that user or the owner has read write bagnio execute.

03:35.080 --> 03:41.020
The group has read no right to rest of the world has read.

03:41.080 --> 03:52.740
No right no exit existing I can make it see my 7 4 4 5 5 2.

03:53.510 --> 04:01.150
And let's see what the permission looks like no less dash it out while too and you can see the permission

04:01.150 --> 04:10.150
is changed now the owner has all three permissions we try to execute the group still has the previous

04:10.150 --> 04:16.160
permissions only read and the rest of the while also only read this is.

04:16.480 --> 04:27.460
And if you further change it let's see smogs 777 file to do any LS.

04:27.940 --> 04:31.320
Gosh A-L a file to know.

04:31.460 --> 04:39.820
Not everybody has all the permissions so this is you'll only do in a situation where you do want everybody

04:39.820 --> 04:46.780
in the group and the rest of the world to have read write and execute to this particular file.

04:46.840 --> 04:52.970
Otherwise this is probably not a good idea to give 7 7 7 2 and 5

04:55.820 --> 04:58.840
OK beside using the numbers.

04:58.890 --> 05:03.320
You can also use characters for instance.

05:03.450 --> 05:05.780
Let's see we have Alastair's.

05:05.870 --> 05:11.120
Well let's pick on file five this time.

05:11.250 --> 05:12.170
So see.

05:12.190 --> 05:22.020
Mom and I want for all of the users to have execute permission on this file.

05:22.020 --> 05:24.190
File 5.

05:24.300 --> 05:25.050
Now let's do it.

05:25.050 --> 05:29.090
LS That scale Bye bye.

05:29.640 --> 05:35.190
And as you can see no owner has read write access.

05:35.320 --> 05:40.690
Eat read write execute group read and execute.

05:40.890 --> 05:43.180
And the rest of the world read and execute.

05:45.090 --> 05:50.930
OK and suppose if I wanted to take away the execute permission for everybody.

05:50.960 --> 05:57.740
C is not a minus X file 5.

05:58.380 --> 06:05.760
And another neat trick if you just went up there in Linux then it'll bring back the command so you don't

06:05.760 --> 06:07.440
have to retype the whole thing again.

06:07.570 --> 06:15.480
So I'm just going to do a bare and up arrow again and enter as you can see my exit queue permission

06:15.480 --> 06:22.830
has gone from all three different kind of yours so you can play around with this would execute as well

06:22.830 --> 06:24.460
as write and read.

06:24.540 --> 06:34.400
Subtract them add them to see how the file is changing and also the octal number 7 4 4 6 4 4 7 7 7.

06:34.410 --> 06:39.020
Try all these different combinations to see what changes you see when you do it.

06:39.030 --> 06:39.960
LS Dashiell.
