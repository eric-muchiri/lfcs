Hello students and welcome in this short lecture we're going to talk about input output redirection.

00:09.310 --> 00:14.470
This is also one of the competencies in your domain.

00:14.470 --> 00:17.290
The first domain of this test.

00:17.290 --> 00:26.680
So what that is actually is instead when we run a command at the at the Seelye in Linux some time you

00:26.680 --> 00:30.430
want to send the output somewhere else.

00:30.640 --> 00:35.350
Are you trying to manipulate the output you don't want to see it that way it's coming because it's either

00:35.350 --> 00:41.110
not readable or you want to save it because you send it or you want to send it over somewhere because

00:41.110 --> 00:45.910
you want to get the output so you can archive it for later on.

00:46.240 --> 00:50.810
And here are some examples that the domain of mentions.

00:50.870 --> 00:56.380
This is redirect as Judy out to a file.

00:56.440 --> 01:02.960
This is the second one is a redirect and append the third one is called a pipe.

01:03.010 --> 01:07.980
Gets used a lot especially when we get into processors and how to manage processes.

01:07.990 --> 01:09.850
I think is the third or fourth domain.

01:09.990 --> 01:11.650
We can't talk about it even more.

01:11.860 --> 01:15.370
And this is redirect error.

01:16.000 --> 01:23.660
The redirect the standard error is used specifically in shell scripting.

01:23.740 --> 01:31.870
So you have a shout that you shellscript that you have created and you can send redirect to a file which

01:31.930 --> 01:38.250
only has get content when your script has some error in it.

01:38.260 --> 01:42.120
So these are a little bit more of a definition.

01:42.120 --> 01:46.600
I wanted to point out redirects Studi out to a file.

01:46.660 --> 01:50.350
This one redirect SDD out and append to a file.

01:50.500 --> 01:56.650
Meaning not only get that you're getting the output from the command that you're going to run by can

01:56.710 --> 01:57.850
append to it also.

01:57.940 --> 01:59.250
And we'll talk about it in a minute.

01:59.270 --> 02:04.170
And we actually run and these are pipes of course.

02:04.240 --> 02:09.910
And the end redirect SDD are standard error.

02:09.910 --> 02:18.110
So currently we are logged into the user Larry and right now he only has one file on it so let's create

02:18.110 --> 02:31.710
a more files file one of your touch file one file to file three.

02:32.030 --> 02:37.130
So now we've got four files of four files all together in one is the script which we're going to use

02:37.130 --> 02:37.790
later.

02:38.090 --> 02:41.030
And the other three are just touched.

02:41.030 --> 02:42.040
So I want to do it.

02:42.050 --> 02:48.560
LS So far you have seen me using just LS formalistic but this time instead of seeing it on the screen

02:48.650 --> 02:51.040
I wanted to go to.

02:51.140 --> 02:54.990
So you do a shift and then there's greater size.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.460
And this is the redirect.

02:56.750 --> 03:01.270
And I want to send it to file listing.

03:02.240 --> 03:05.320
So you see they didn't list anything on the screen this time.

03:05.330 --> 03:05.960
Why.

03:05.960 --> 03:10.340
Because I have redirected to file listing.

03:10.340 --> 03:15.460
And as you can see it has automatically the file listing wasn't even there before it created that file

03:15.710 --> 03:17.560
and put the listing in there.

03:18.260 --> 03:21.210
And less to make sure that actually did that.

03:21.260 --> 03:22.930
We'll do more.

03:22.940 --> 03:26.430
We can either do more our cat to look at a file kit.

03:26.450 --> 03:33.040
So let's do a cat instead file listing and guess what.

03:33.110 --> 03:38.540
It's got everything that Alice was supposed to show you on the screen instead of showing on the screen.

03:38.690 --> 03:47.640
It put it in that file now we're going to use the same command but instead we get her to the redirect

03:47.650 --> 03:49.860
in the past let's see what happened in this one.

03:50.220 --> 03:51.980
So we do.

03:52.620 --> 04:00.770
LS and stood up one grader decided we're going to have to file listing.

04:01.950 --> 04:04.130
OK so we still have the file listing file.

04:04.230 --> 04:06.050
But look at the content now.

04:07.890 --> 04:09.850
File system.

04:10.590 --> 04:13.470
And as you can see the content has doubled.

04:13.710 --> 04:16.140
It had whatever it previously had.

04:16.410 --> 04:23.540
And then it appended it again because are giving it to the greater than signs.

04:23.680 --> 04:28.280
So we are saying that redirect and append as well.

04:28.590 --> 04:31.950
Now we're going to use them more our pipe command.

04:32.190 --> 04:37.420
So let's see it is a very important directory.

04:37.470 --> 04:46.000
There are a lot of configuration files that reside there and we want to see it few lines at a time.

04:46.130 --> 04:46.810
OK.

04:46.980 --> 04:49.210
Because it might scroll off the screen.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.280
So we'll do a pipe and

04:54.930 --> 04:56.840
more and then enter.

04:56.890 --> 05:01.810
So as you can see it this goes all the way to the bottom and then there's more at the bottom.

05:02.010 --> 05:08.370
And when you have this you can either hit enter to see one line at a time and there are way too many

05:08.370 --> 05:12.100
lines and you want to see next page you can hit the space bar.

05:12.100 --> 05:12.680
There you go.

05:14.210 --> 05:20.250
And it keeps giving me page after page of what is listed under slashy DC that many files are listed

05:20.790 --> 05:21.480
under slash.

05:21.480 --> 05:24.310
DC.

05:24.480 --> 05:29.850
And last bit up this lecture is a redirect.

05:29.870 --> 05:31.120
Standard Error.

05:31.270 --> 05:38.170
So I help that you probably saw my files called my script I've created this script and days intentionally

05:39.340 --> 05:44.410
or mistakenly The script is too complex.

05:44.420 --> 05:51.630
I mean we are getting into scripting right now but asking to remove a system file which doesn't exist.

05:51.940 --> 05:58.690
So on purpose you know we made this error when we'll see how the redirect takes care of it.

05:58.990 --> 06:07.670
So we're going to say this is how you write a script doc slash and it's my script.

06:07.870 --> 06:13.780
And also you can type the first couple of characters and hit the tab key and complete your command for

06:13.780 --> 06:14.550
you.

06:14.880 --> 06:24.730
Let's if they are more then one command in that subdirectory which are identical to modify a file one

06:24.730 --> 06:26.070
file to file three.

06:26.140 --> 06:31.570
Then if you type f I try to tab that the system doesn't know which file you're talking about.

06:31.570 --> 06:33.520
5 1 5 2 5 3 right.

06:33.580 --> 06:35.530
In that case you have to type the whole thing.

06:35.740 --> 06:43.430
But since the script my script is the only file with that name I just typed in my and just kept it and

06:43.430 --> 06:51.840
it finished the whole thing and now I'm going to use the redirect and I'm going to send it to a file

06:51.840 --> 06:53.660
called error file.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.970
So your file doesn't exist right now or is going to send the error to this file and create that file

06:59.970 --> 07:01.660
and send the error to that file.

07:02.190 --> 07:02.550
OK.

07:02.730 --> 07:07.520
So it's showing you on the screen as well that this is the error error code to D6.

07:07.950 --> 07:09.050
And let's see what the

07:11.880 --> 07:14.020
and this are Eriphyle.

07:15.270 --> 07:21.270
And I'm going to do more on file and this is the actual error.

07:22.540 --> 07:27.340
It's telling you that you have a command in there to remove something and that file or directory doesn't

07:27.340 --> 07:29.510
exist or we cannot remove it.

07:30.190 --> 07:32.560
So this is how the redirect.

07:32.560 --> 07:36.370
And just like any other topic this topic is fairly broad as well.

07:36.370 --> 07:40.040
There are a lot of ways you can use it.

07:40.720 --> 07:46.050
But as far as your exam is concerned this should be sufficient if you want to research it more you know

07:46.060 --> 07:52.630
you can definitely do the man pages or search it online and get more information if you want me to elaborate

07:52.630 --> 07:53.430
further.

07:53.440 --> 07:58.960
Please make sure to leave a comment and any other confusion about or something I'll definitely explain

07:58.990 --> 07:59.760
to you.
