Fellow students.

00:02.220 --> 00:08.920
So no we are going to log in into each one of our operating systems that he's called previously.

00:08.970 --> 00:20.010
Currently we are at the book to server command line and our user in this machine was Cur-Lee

00:23.980 --> 00:25.590
and password.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.600
And there we are log in right now.

00:28.840 --> 00:32.470
So in Linux there are two kinds of users.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.700
These are regular user like the one we just created.

00:35.770 --> 00:43.120
And of course on that one machine you could hundreds of users and there's going to be super user or

00:43.120 --> 00:50.920
root user and that is if you're coming from a Windows background that is similar to an administrator

00:51.520 --> 01:00.040
on a Windows machine which have all the powers to make and break things basically can change things.

01:00.040 --> 01:03.220
You can write to files that other people cannot.

01:03.580 --> 01:05.430
That the regular users cannot.

01:05.620 --> 01:07.780
So it's a good practice.

01:07.840 --> 01:17.050
Always log into a Linux machine using a non root I can only switch to root account when you really have

01:17.050 --> 01:24.310
to change something or if there's a file that you cannot see because it requires root permission to

01:24.310 --> 01:26.060
even look at it.

01:26.770 --> 01:30.380
So and we're going to discuss those in detail later.

01:31.180 --> 01:38.280
So if I want to exit out of here I can just simply type it and I'm back at the

01:46.310 --> 01:56.010
log out and log on will also get me logged out of the system and back to the problem in not going to

01:56.010 --> 01:59.680
look at Susa Linux.

01:59.860 --> 02:08.640
And since my machine right now is showing a locked I just have to type in the password and I'm back

02:08.760 --> 02:09.970
in.

02:10.050 --> 02:16.710
So I'm in the back in the Gulli and there are two ways you can lock your machine.

02:16.710 --> 02:22.320
So if you're leaving suppose if you're in a work environment is always always always a good idea to

02:22.320 --> 02:24.190
lock your screen.

02:24.360 --> 02:27.740
Don't just assume that eventually is the lock itself out.

02:28.080 --> 02:32.840
But because during that time it's somebody you really want to disrupt stuff.

02:33.390 --> 02:36.930
They can come and do it and you'll be blamed for it because you're a machine.

02:36.930 --> 02:41.440
So always have good ideas good security practice to lock screen.

02:41.580 --> 02:50.730
And if you are completely leaving the system you can leave and you'll you'll get these options suspend

02:50.760 --> 02:54.510
reboot shut down and log out so you can log out

02:57.540 --> 03:03.170
and you can back at the problem and hear from here and type in the password again.

03:07.850 --> 03:11.260
And your log back.

03:11.730 --> 03:18.230
Now we're at our Centaurus machine and Larry is a user on that

03:22.540 --> 03:29.610
logged it although I kind of briefly went over all of this during the installation process as well.

03:29.820 --> 03:34.440
But since this is part of your domain and competencies.

03:34.680 --> 03:41.190
So I wanted to make sure that I do show it to you again just so you know in each of these operating

03:41.190 --> 03:46.040
system how does the log in and log out process works.

03:46.050 --> 03:48.280
So on to this machine.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.470
You see this little power button here.

03:51.230 --> 03:53.180
You just click on that.

03:54.290 --> 03:59.430
And from here you just click on the user and you have the lock out option here.

04:01.730 --> 04:07.520
And then will prompt you you're going to be locked out in 60 seconds and you can do it earlier.

04:09.340 --> 04:14.490
And that should bring you back to the log in go.

04:14.520 --> 04:22.470
So this is how you log in and log out of all these three flavors of Linux that you have discussed so

04:22.470 --> 04:23.260
far.
