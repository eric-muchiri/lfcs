Hello and welcome again in this lecture we're going to talk about how to connect remotely.

00:07.780 --> 00:12.500
Suppose if you're not sitting in front of the system and you're on your Windows machine or any other

00:12.520 --> 00:17.910
Linux machine then how can you connect to the server that you want to connect to.

00:18.250 --> 00:23.950
So what you do is you put an IP address or hostname as long as it's in the DNS.

00:24.040 --> 00:29.180
You can use the host name as well but IP address.

00:29.380 --> 00:36.160
In my case I've already saved it in this tool called party and Safari tool you can download on your

00:36.160 --> 00:37.310
Windows machine.

00:37.570 --> 00:41.950
If it's not already downloaded then you can use this.

00:42.010 --> 00:48.280
I call this machine Roundhead as soon as I click load it brings up the IP address that I only saved

00:48.320 --> 00:52.000
it and I call the section right here.

00:52.500 --> 01:00.110
And when I open it it gives me a prompt you know I'm going to type in my user in

01:03.140 --> 01:04.660
passport a minute.

01:05.240 --> 01:13.530
So this is how you could connect remotely to another system that you're not in front of not suppose

01:13.620 --> 01:17.000
you are already on a Linux machine.

01:17.140 --> 01:22.050
There is another machine within the network that I can connect to.

01:22.050 --> 01:26.230
The way I do that is S-sh which is the secure shell.

01:26.310 --> 01:34.350
There are two ways you can connect via telnet and by S-sh and there's a little one called Remote sh

01:34.430 --> 01:35.510
r r s h.

01:35.730 --> 01:41.250
What S-sh is the most secure and most cables are that you going to be using was probably told it is

01:41.250 --> 01:47.360
usually disable because it says the password in clear text.

01:47.400 --> 01:50.910
So that's why telnet just have a bad reputation.

01:51.030 --> 01:53.280
I had used most of the time.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.140
So I always use S-sh.

01:55.140 --> 02:00.030
So I'm going to another machine which is in the same network.

02:00.360 --> 02:02.090
I'm going to use its IP address.

02:02.190 --> 02:07.940
So I I to say S-sh root cause I don't know the I don't have it.

02:08.340 --> 02:09.880
A regular user on that machine.

02:10.030 --> 02:10.370
I do.

02:10.370 --> 02:11.740
I know the root password.

02:12.060 --> 02:18.220
So when I say root at that IP address or I will if I wanted to I can put a hostname as well.

02:18.450 --> 02:23.270
As long as the DNS can look up the IP address I can use that as well.

02:23.340 --> 02:24.480
So that's all you do.

02:24.720 --> 02:32.240
I see a sh username at IP address or costly and Ill ask you for password.

02:32.370 --> 02:39.500
I will copy and paste it because I've got a complicated password in there you know.

02:39.620 --> 02:42.740
So you but is subject to a sheet and a blog right.

02:43.640 --> 02:51.120
So this is how you log in by using putty or by using S-sh from the lead sheet.

02:51.190 --> 02:51.700
OK.

02:51.710 --> 03:00.860
One other topic that I want to discuss in this lecture is how to work with files how to create files

03:00.860 --> 03:04.460
delete files copy files move files and directories.

03:04.730 --> 03:05.190
OK.

03:05.430 --> 03:13.130
So one way I've already showed you that you can just use touch command to create a file and then if

03:13.130 --> 03:17.480
I want to write no like my file one file to file three there are empty files.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.940
But suppose I want them empty want to put something in there.

03:21.380 --> 03:24.200
So what I use I can use some kind of editor.

03:24.360 --> 03:32.070
There's a vi at Richard there's a vi editor and there are several other so I'm using vi editor right.

03:32.320 --> 03:36.980
And now inside the file that this file is not going to be empty because I'm going to write something

03:36.980 --> 03:37.410
in it.

03:37.610 --> 03:46.060
So I type it I insert mode and then I type my name is Joe.

03:46.190 --> 03:48.480
Now this file is not empty anymore.

03:49.070 --> 03:50.690
I just wrote something in it.

03:50.990 --> 03:53.780
So this is how you create a file.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.680
The guy is supposed to follow does not exist at all.

03:57.680 --> 04:02.390
Like a test to default didn't exist.

04:02.390 --> 04:09.950
I just used a vi editor and I created this file and I just wrote something in it and I'm going to do

04:10.650 --> 04:11.940
this semi color.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.070
Let me get to the bottom of this so you can see the whole thing.

04:19.560 --> 04:23.220
So WQ bang is going to save and exit.

04:23.320 --> 04:27.280
If you just do Q then it's going to exit without safety.

04:27.580 --> 04:33.430
If you do w bank is going to save and let you stay in the.

04:33.690 --> 04:38.480
So I suppose if I don't want one of these files.

04:38.730 --> 04:45.430
So all I do is are it has to remove remove that file is gone.

04:45.590 --> 04:48.770
If you do it at less There you will see it.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.040
Test 2 is gone.

04:50.430 --> 04:50.960
OK.

04:51.090 --> 04:54.410
So you have created a file you have deleter file.

04:54.420 --> 05:01.160
Now I want a copy watermark created in file 1 2 5 4.

05:01.550 --> 05:13.020
OK so copy file 1 to file for the file for and you with their files one was there but let's see what's

05:13.110 --> 05:13.620
inside.

05:13.620 --> 05:14.910
File for now.

05:16.380 --> 05:22.870
It copy the contents from file one into created files for first and then copy my content.

05:23.220 --> 05:24.340
So they are identical.

05:24.380 --> 05:32.310
So it's always a good idea to make a copy before you make any edits to any of the lyrics for assistance.

05:32.310 --> 05:37.860
Always a good idea so that you have a backup copy and if you mess up then you can always go back.

05:38.340 --> 05:42.470
Another way you can make a copy but that's that case you're not going to have a back.

05:42.930 --> 05:56.340
Suppose if I were to do move and the file 1 5 5 5 5 doesn't exist right here what happens I do or less

05:57.060 --> 06:03.090
like file when it's completely gone and file files there so that I don't have a backup but I have.

06:03.270 --> 06:11.770
This is basically used to change to finally a file because for whatever reason I still like file what

06:12.120 --> 06:14.030
I wanted it to be 5 5.

06:14.340 --> 06:19.880
So I just moved all the content and just got rid of one in one step.

06:21.650 --> 06:24.230
So poppys is still your bet or is your best friend.

06:24.270 --> 06:29.830
You make a copy first and then do whatever you want with the file because then you have a copy of

06:33.270 --> 06:38.000
directories you do and Khidir make directories.

06:38.180 --> 06:44.040
That's what the shortest far less call at the horizon.

06:44.070 --> 06:50.490
I don't know where this word popped into my head but just less creative director called Horizon.

06:50.830 --> 06:56.880
And if you do it LS test it out see the colors different varieties of that tells you right there that

06:56.970 --> 06:58.350
it is a directory.

06:58.460 --> 07:04.900
If I do it less and less dash I'll look at this file.

07:04.990 --> 07:07.720
This directory where it starts with the D

07:13.610 --> 07:18.870
the right now this directory's empty it has no files underneath it.

07:18.870 --> 07:19.920
Right.

07:20.010 --> 07:22.420
So I can do R and D.

07:24.480 --> 07:32.960
Know the horizon is removed if you move binary tree is gone.

07:34.050 --> 07:43.950
However if I have files underneath it suppose a file created to get Victor horizon and then CD into

07:44.190 --> 07:52.890
horizon now gone into the directory if you do a P.W. Dener present working directory you see whole Larry

07:53.130 --> 08:00.810
has a directory called Horizon and inside that directory and now whatever file I create will be owned

08:00.810 --> 08:02.150
by this directory.

08:02.220 --> 08:04.820
So touch file

08:07.530 --> 08:13.070
while 6.

08:13.220 --> 08:16.870
So now this directory has a file underneath it.

08:17.180 --> 08:25.510
I went one step up and now I'm going to do our FBI our horizon.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.430
It's not letting me delete it.

08:27.510 --> 08:29.600
Just saying it's not empty anymore.

08:30.220 --> 08:35.100
So what you have to do is you have to see the horizon first

08:39.660 --> 08:46.280
do less Ahram file six to get rid of that file.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.460
Now other directories.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.130
Let's see if you could delete it.

08:49.130 --> 08:49.910
No.

08:50.050 --> 08:53.110
R and D are right.

08:55.740 --> 09:01.850
So unless the directory is empty it's not going to let you delete it.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.910
There's a record to delete.

09:03.960 --> 09:07.740
So do our man on our DVR.

09:07.980 --> 09:12.640
And there's a way you can delete it with everything in it.

09:12.780 --> 09:16.320
All the files in it and recursively because you have a lot of files in it.

09:16.330 --> 09:20.540
You don't want to go one by one and delete the files then delete the directory.

09:20.580 --> 09:22.530
So there is a way to do it recursively.

09:22.650 --> 09:29.910
And I'll let you research it by using men and pictures and I probably put this question in the quizzes

09:29.910 --> 09:36.080
are are one of the assignments also so that way you'll get a refresher that will.
