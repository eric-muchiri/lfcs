Hello and welcome again in this lecture we're going to talk about the well known streamlets it is called

00:09.210 --> 00:12.580
said R S E D.

00:12.870 --> 00:18.810
I'll show you some examples of it because it is listed as one of the competencies in your domain one

00:19.110 --> 00:24.470
so you might get asked questions about.

00:24.880 --> 00:29.740
So I've made a copy of the passport file and that's what you get a plain old password file is a very

00:29.740 --> 00:30.390
important file.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.330
So you don't want to directly mess with it.

00:32.680 --> 00:40.630
But if you want to you can just get a type in a paragraph about five or six or ten lines and just use

00:40.630 --> 00:42.230
God as a test file.

00:42.460 --> 00:44.630
But I'm using the password file.

00:44.830 --> 00:52.030
So I call it my password and put it into Larry's whole directory and this is what I'm here to do some

00:52.150 --> 01:03.150
typing set which is a stream editor dash and you know that I'm going to want to read lines five to 10

01:03.360 --> 01:04.380
out of this.

01:04.380 --> 01:05.500
It's a big file.

01:05.570 --> 01:09.090
I'm only reading 5 to 10 all of this.

01:09.110 --> 01:17.070
Can people just stop at 10 in the file is my password.

01:17.070 --> 01:17.920
There you go.

01:17.940 --> 01:22.240
So it's basically reading me only five files.

01:22.530 --> 01:29.190
So you have cut down the information that we need out of the whole password file because the rest of

01:29.190 --> 01:33.060
the information is it's not rather than for us.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.040
So that's why.

01:34.250 --> 01:38.880
So this is one of the use we are going to use another example in this file.

01:38.910 --> 01:45.360
In this example it is possible to print the entire file except a certain range.

01:45.390 --> 01:54.900
So suppose you want to exclude the files from 20 to 30 the lines from 20 30 out of the password file.

01:55.310 --> 01:58.170
Those are the lines that I want to exclude.

01:58.220 --> 02:08.180
So this how you do that said 20 Kubla 30 de

02:10.960 --> 02:14.770
la password.

02:14.800 --> 02:24.240
So right now it's showing everything except the line between 20 to 30.

02:24.250 --> 02:31.020
No this was just a Vueling suppose I wanted to play something I want to replace I started it said

02:34.250 --> 02:40.840
in single quotes to get put in S which means switch and we've got to switch.

02:40.840 --> 02:42.250
Let's see.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.260
House.

02:52.970 --> 02:58.610
In the G is like the ending of switching and POS Palm Pilot.

02:58.630 --> 02:59.350
My password

03:02.260 --> 03:11.470
and as you can see in the entire file there very ever there was whole of house so it's a very nifty

03:12.100 --> 03:17.230
tool that you can use that can really shorten your editing process.

03:17.260 --> 03:23.770
Instead of going line by line and changing something you are changing adjust on the fly and has a lot

03:23.770 --> 03:28.710
of options available that you can go through and see if you really want to learn more about it.

03:29.110 --> 03:36.040
But in a short lecture without boring you with all the other examples that should give you an idea of

03:36.100 --> 03:38.110
what the OC does.
