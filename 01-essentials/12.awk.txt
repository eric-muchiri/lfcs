Awk

An awk program is made up of patterns and actions to be performed when a pattern match is found

Scans input lines sequentially and examines each line to determine whether it contains a pattern specified by the user

When a matching pattern is found, awk carries out the instructions in the prorgram
 e.g
`awk '//{print $1, $2, $3}' file1`


-prints the first three words of the text in file1

`awk //{print}' /etc/hosts'` - prints the /etc/hosts file

`awk /localhost/{print}' /etc/hosts'` - filters for entries with the word localhost in the /etc/hosts file

`awk /[0-9]/{print}` /etc/hosts -filters for entries with numbers 0 to 9
