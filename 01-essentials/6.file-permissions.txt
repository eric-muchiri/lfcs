Linux file permissions


First 10 characters in ls -al output

the first character shows the type of file
`-` - a  regular file
`d` - a directory
`-l` - symbolic link
`c` - character device
`b` - block

The next 9 characters represent the file mode which includes read, write and execute file permissions of:

    the file's owner
    the file's group owner
    the rest of the users

    r     w    x
    2^2  2^1  2^0
    
    rwx=4+2+1=7
    
    r--=4+0+0=4
    
For instance a file can have permisions like 744

    7-Owner has read, write and execute permissions
    4-the group owner has read only rights
    4-the rest of the users have only read rigts

`chmod`- command used to change the permissions of a dile
e.g chmod 744 file2
    ls -al file2
    
besides using numbers you can use characters
e.g chmod a+x file5

    `a`- all the users
    `+` - add permission
    `x`- execute rights
    
    chmod a-x file 5
    
    `u` - user/owner
    `g` - group
